# STAT231-S18-GroupM
STAT231 project group (Alex Chaffers and Robbie Zielinski)

To-do list

* Create package with wrapper functions to sql calls to make data easily accessible
* Explore geocodes that we currently have: why are there so many results in Europe?
* Figure out how to make plots render more quickly. Right now they are not possible to work with.
